### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<!-- **PedroJuanSoto/PedroJuanSoto** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using coding theory for distributed matrix, polynomial, and tensor computations and also working on applications of computer algebra to other branches of science
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on coding theory for distributed function computation, computer algebra projects for polynomial and matrix computations, and more generally applications of algebra, combinatorics, and logic to computing and other branches of science
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with looking for open problems to apply my knowledge to
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning about different applications such as: the applications of algebraic geometry codes to things other than distributed computing, applications of computer algebra to Cognitive Neuroscience and Biology, and quantum computing
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Coding theory for distributed computing projects, computer algebra projects for polynomial, matrix, and tensor computations, and more generally applications of algebra, combinatorics, and logic to computing and other branches of science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pedrosoto@vt.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can play the guitar and love the outdoors
