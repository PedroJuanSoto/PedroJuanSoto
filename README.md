### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**PedroJuanSoto/PedroJuanSoto** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using coding theory for distributed polynomial and matrix computation and also working on applications of computer algebra to other branches of science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about different applications of computer algebra to Biology and Neuroscience, the use of coding theory to distributed machine learning and quantum computing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on coding theory for distributed function computation, computer algebra projects for polynomial and matrix copmutations, and more generally applications of algebra, combinatorics, and logic to computing and other branches of science
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with looking for open problems to apply my knowledge to 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Coding theory for distributed computing projects, computer algebra projects for polynomial and matrix copmutations, and more generally applications of algebra, combinatorics, and logic to computing and other branches of science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: psoto@gradcenter.cuny.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can play the guitar and love the outdoors
